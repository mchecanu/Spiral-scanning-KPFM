# Spiral-scanning-KPFM

This is the notebook I used for the data analysis of the Article: M.Checa et. al "High speed mapping of surface charge dynamics via Spiral Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy ", (2023).

Structure:
  1. Imports
  2. Image reconstruction Functions (CS and GP)
  3. Import single data file and tune CS parameters
  4. Compare CS and GP reconstruction
  5. Reconstruct full CPD maps of whole time dependent dataset using CS --> Generate Animation
  6. Reconstruct full CPD maps of whole time dependent dataset using GP --> Generate Animation
  7. Perform single pixel fitting to find characteristic time.
  8. Perform the fitting in every pixel generating time constant maps.
  9. Study of the SNR comparision between raster and spiral scann.
  10. Topographical and CPD gradient images

Experimental Data Files are abailable upon request.
